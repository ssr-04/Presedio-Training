Availability:
 - Minimize downtime (To ensure the uptime of the system)
 - Ways:
    - Replication or redundancy (copy of the server for the reader only)
    - Auto Recovery
 - Causes (Maintainance time, Crashes, Hardware failure, Network failure)
 - In case of crashes -> Auto Recovery
 - Network & Hardware failure -> Monitor and switch to Replication

 Redundancy:
    - Master and slave architecture
    - Master -> Primary server
    - Slave -> Secondary standby (in case of crashes/other failures and also as load balancer)
    -- When Master goes down promote slave as Primary
    -- Also on high traffic, use slave as load balancer
    -- Tools --
        -> REPMGR - Node manager for failover
        -> PgBouncer - Connection pooling
        -> Pgpool - Load balancing + connection pooling

Streaming replication - WAL (Write ahead log) -> Inbuilt
- Replication created is read only

Logical replication - Table level replication 
- It's bidirectly uses pub/sub model

Synchorized and Asynzhorized replication -> Good to use Synchorized
