1) Design a C# console app that uses a jagged array to store data for Instagram posts by multiple users. Each user can have a different number of posts, and each post stores a caption and number of likes.

You have N users, and each user can have M posts (varies per user).

Each post has:

A caption (string)

A number of likes (int)

Store this in a jagged array, where each index represents one user's list of posts.

Display all posts grouped by user.

No file/database needed â€” console input/output only.

Example output
Enter number of users: 2

User 1: How many posts? 2
Enter caption for post 1: Sunset at beach
Enter likes: 150
Enter caption for post 2: Coffee time
Enter likes: 89

User 2: How many posts? 1
Enter caption for post 1: Hiking adventure
Enter likes: 230

--- Displaying Instagram Posts ---
User 1:
Post 1 - Caption: Sunset at beach | Likes: 150
Post 2 - Caption: Coffee time | Likes: 89

User 2:
Post 1 - Caption: Hiking adventure | Likes: 230


Test case
| User | Number of Posts | Post Captions        | Likes      |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | 2               | "Lunch", "Road Trip" | 40, 120    |
| 2    | 1               | "Workout"            | 75         |
| 3    | 3               | "Book", "Tea", "Cat" | 30, 15, 60 |
