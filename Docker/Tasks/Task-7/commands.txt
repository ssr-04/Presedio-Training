1) Creating swarm for services
docker swarm init

2) Initial services (outdated)
docker service create \
  --name nginx-service \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  nginx:1.25-alpine

3) Updating them while running
docker service update \
--image nginx:alpine \
nginx-service

Note:
- Performs rolling updates (one task at a time by default)
- Ensures no downtime

4) verification

docker service ls
docker service ps nginx-service

Note:
Look for tasks with Shutdown, Running, and New states. You should see old containers being replaced one by one.

5) Cleanup

docker service rm nginx-service
docker swarm leave --force
