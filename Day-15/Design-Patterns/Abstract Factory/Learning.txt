The Abstract Factory Design Pattern
Intent:
- Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Key Concepts:

- Abstract Product: Interfaces or abstract classes for a set of related products (e.g., IButton, ICheckbox, ITextbox). Each abstract product defines the common interface for a particular type of component within the family.

- Concrete Product: Specific implementations of Abstract Products (e.g., WindowsButton, MacOSButton, WindowsCheckbox, MacOSCheckbox). These are the actual objects created by the factories.

- Abstract Factory: An interface or abstract class that declares a set of factory methods for creating each of the Abstract Products (e.g., ICreateUIElements, IWidgetFactory). It defines a contract for creating a family of products.

- Concrete Factory: Specific implementations of the Abstract Factory. Each Concrete Factory implements the factory methods to produce a specific family of Concrete Products (e.g., WindowsUIFactory creates WindowsButton, WindowsCheckbox; MacOSUIFactory creates MacOSButton, MacOSCheckbox).

Client: The code that uses the Abstract Factory and Abstract Products. The client interacts only with the abstract interfaces, remaining unaware of the specific concrete factories or products being used.

Why use it?

- Ensures Product Compatibility: It guarantees that the products created by a single concrete factory are compatible with each other. For example, a WindowsUIFactory will always produce Windows-style buttons, checkboxes, etc., ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- Decoupling: It decouples the client code from the concrete product classes and concrete factory classes. The client only relies on the abstract factory and abstract product interfaces.
- Flexibility and Extensibility: You can easily swap entire families of products by changing the concrete factory used at runtime. Adding a new family (e.g., LinuxUIFactory) doesn't require modifying existing client code. This strongly supports the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).
